# .dotfiles

Juanma's dotfiles, heavily inspired on [Luke Smith's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice)

- Settings for:
	- Xorg
	- Zsh (Main Shell)
	- Alacritty (Terminal emulator)
	- Zathura (Document viewer)
	- Neovim (Text Editor)
	- VSCodium (IDE)
	- Sxiv (Image viewer)
	- Less (Pager)
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- _Some_ ~~(tons of)~~ environmental variables have been set in `~/.profile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
